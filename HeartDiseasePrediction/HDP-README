**Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**
This Python project aims to predict heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. 
The dataset used for this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Overview**
Heart disease is a significant health problem worldwide. 
Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can greatly help in preventing its adverse effects. 
This project employs machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes.


**Algorithms Used**
Logistic Regression: A linear classification algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks.
Decision Tree: A tree-based classification algorithm that makes decisions based on feature splits.
XGBoost with Tuned Hyperparameters and Cross-Validation: An advanced ensemble learning algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy. 
                                                          Hyperparameters are optimized using cross-validation techniques to enhance model performance.
